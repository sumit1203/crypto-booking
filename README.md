# Crypto Booking [Proof of Concept]

This repository contains all the necessary solutions to offer hotel rooms in exchange for ETH or Lif tokens. It is compound by a web app, server signer, and smart contracts, it connects directly to WT API, the hotel needs to be deployed in one of WT networks.

## Is it a Dapp?

This is the very first app built using the WT Open API for hotel distribution, and since we don't have pricing and availability yet integrated into the API, we are using centralized solutions for now. The goal is to migrate to more decentralized solutions provided by WT in a future..

## App
 The web app to show hotel inventory from WT API is located inside of the [app](https://github.com/windingtree/crypto-booking/tree/develop/app)
directory

## Server
 The server to sign offers and manage bookings is located inside of the [server](https://github.com/windingtree/crypto-booking/tree/develop/server)
directory

## Smart contracts
 The smart contracts to manage rooms availability is located inside of the [smart-contracts](https://github.com/windingtree/crypto-booking/tree/develop/contracts)
directory

## Test

To test in a local environment, you have to:

1.- Run `npm run testnet` in contracts folder and leave it in the background.
2.- Run `npm run deploy-local` in the contracts folder and copy the Lif token and BookingPoC address in the dev configuration files in server and app.
3.- Run `npm run dev` on the server, leave it in the background.
4.- Run `npm start` on the app, leave it in the background.

## Release
### Version

- Update server, app and global `package.json` continuously.
- Merge from develop to master branch.
- Create a new Git tag. This will trigger the deploy in `Travis-CI`
